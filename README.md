Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning
This project implements a machine learning-based system to classify emails as spam or non-spam. The goal is to understand text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques used in real-world NLP problems.

The project uses TF-IDF for text vectorization and applies classification models such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Technologies used include Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK.
